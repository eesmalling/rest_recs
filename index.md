## Problem Statement

>We will create a recommendation system for restaurants in Ontario and Quebec, Canada using regularized regression, matrix factorization, and random forest regression, and combine them using an ensemble method.

Recommendation systems are a crucial feature of any online business, matching users with products on Amazon, movies on Netflix, dates on OkCupid, and beyond! An effective recommendation system can increase a business' revenue while also increasing user satisfaction, and so they are the subject of much research. However, the best approach to developing a recommendation system depends on the specific problem at hand.

For restaurant reviews, it is difficult to understand a user's preferences until she begins reviewing restaurants, known as the "cold start" problem. Similarly, it is difficult to assess a restaurant's features and overall popularity until many users have reviewed it. However, as more data is amassed, methods such as matrix factorization become computationally intensive. If implemented properly, though, these systems can better understand user preferences over time and thus increase user loyalty.
